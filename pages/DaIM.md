- here the exam questions that I remember please give me feedback to complete questions =>
- Explain in your own words SNRF and domain independence relation
- If connected return true —> . —->  if not connected return false —> .  <——
- write a stratisfied datalog program
- Write while loop datalog program
	- If you reach {()} empty set it will return false
	- Convert to RC query

	  ---
- Explain full reducer => remove dangling tuples and consistent instance
	- Given q1 and q2 both are cyclic we can’t proceed GYO  find minimal query (remove Self Joins)
	  id:: 67800f0c-0a5c-47f8-82f4-d03bfdc9662b
- Are the queries cyclic or acyclic
	- Apply GYO Calculate Fractional edge
	  ---
- Explain in your own words Canonical apply chase method and  does it always terminate when there are infinite set?
	- You will always reach a fixedpoint so it will always terminate.

- Here the schema Product database give create universal solution
  Create universal solution TGDS(Source to target)
  Glav, GAV, LAV comparison according to question 3.2
  If you find acyclic apply yannakakis algorithm
- Certain semantics Product and productOrigin and ProductScore what is return ?
	- our aim to create certain consistent target database removing null values.
- 10 multiple choice questions only 1 answer is correct
- Mostly 5 questions related datalog stratify and negation
  1 - given negation datalog one of them negate first and the last one negated last. So is this statified 
  or is this  ¬¬ Datalog ? or linear programmable Datalog ?
  2- query minimization p time ?
  all monotonic under homomorfism ?
  3- All LAV(source to target) can be easily mapped to universal solution GAV(Target to source) ?
  4- Canonical apply chase method does it always terminate when infinite step  ?
  yes chase apply until you reach fixed point.So it always terminate
