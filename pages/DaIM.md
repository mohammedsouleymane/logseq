- Compute the following join using the Yannakakis algorithm.
	- (x,y) <- R(x,y,z),S(v,y,w),T(x,y,v),U(y,v,u,s),V(y,u),W(u,s).
		- Is this query minimal ? if no give me equivalent query ?
		- Verify that this query is acyclic
		- Apply the GYO algorithm
		- Give a full reducer for the query
		- Give a join tree for the query
		- Illustrate the Yannakakis algorithm by computing it step by step over an example
		  database instance.

- Explain in your own words Canonical apply chase method and  does it always terminate when there are infinite set?
	- You will always reach a fixpoint so it will always terminate.
