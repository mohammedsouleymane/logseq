## Lecture 1
	- Gapminder, hans rosling
		- Let the dataset change you mindset
		- animated presentation in space and time
	- MindXpres Data visualisation
		- interactive data visualisation
		- interactive source code visualisation
		- enhanced video player
	- Australia Bushfires
		- Not a satellite image
		- 3D visualisation of one month of data
			- data collected by Nasa
		- Information visualisation can be misused to deliver the wrong message
	- What is Visualisation (Vis)?
		- **Computer-based visualisation systems provide visual representations of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively**
		- Augmentation of human capabilities
		- A vis idiom is a distinct approach to creating and manipulation visual representations
			- find best design for a particular task
		- Resource limitations
			- computers: computational capacity and scalability
			- humans: perceptual and cognitive capacity
			- displays: number of pixels
				- information density (data-ink ratio) = amount of information vs unused space
	- Why use Visualisation?
		- Human eyes have superpower
			- visual system provides very high-bandwidth channel
		- Visual reasoning is way faster and more reliable than mental reasoning
			- perceptual interferences based on spatial location etc.
		- External representation or "external cognition"
			- augment human capacity beyond internal cognition and memory
			- information can be organised by spatial location
		- Summarise information without losing details (details on demand)
	- Human in the loop
		- many analysis problems are ill specified
			- many possible questions to be asked
			- human-in-the-loop exploration making use of human pattern detection
			- augment human capabilities rather than replacing the human in the loop
		- exploratory analysis for scientific discovery (data analysis)
		- visualization tools for presentation (communication)
			- presenting existing knowledge
	- Computer in the loop
		- visualisations of large datasets that might dynamically change over time
	- Showing dataset details
		- exploring a dataset to find patterns
			- not possible if you only see a summary of the dataset
		- assessing the validity of a statistical model
			- does the model fit the data?
		- statistical characterisation (descriptive statistics) of a dataset loses information through summarisatoin
			- single summary often an oversimplication hiding the true structure of a dataset
			- anscombe's quartet ("Anscombe's quartet **comprises
			   four datasets that have nearly identical simple descriptive statistics,
			   yet have very different distributions and appear very different when 
			  graphed**" wiki)
	- **Interactivity is necessary for vis tools handling complexity**
		- limitation of people and displays make it **impossible to show a large dataset at once**
		- change level of details
		- show **different aspect** of a dataset
		- different **representation and summaries** of data
		- different **presentation** of data
	- Difficulties in design
		- main issue is that vast majority of the possibilities in the design space will be ineffective for any specific usage context
		- design might be a poor match with human perceptual and cognitive system
		- design might be a bad match with the intended task
		- design alternatives: consider multiple alternative and choose the best one!
