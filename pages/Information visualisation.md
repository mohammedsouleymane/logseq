		- Let the dataset change you mindset
		- animated presentation in space and time
	- MindXpres Data visualisation
		- interactive data visualisation
		- interactive source code visualisation
		- enhanced video player
	- Australia Bushfires
		- Not a satellite image
		- 3D visualisation of one month of data
			- data collected by Nasa
		- Information visualisation can be misused to deliver the wrong message
	- What is Visualisation (Vis)?
		- **Computer-based visualisation systems provide visual representations of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively**
		- Augmentation of human capabilities
		- A vis idiom is a distinct approach to creating and manipulation visual representations
			- find best design for a particular task
		- Resource limitations
			- computers: computational capacity and scalability
			- humans: perceptual and cognitive capacity
			- displays: number of pixels
				- information density (data-ink ratio) = amount of information vs unused space
	- Why use Visualisation? (HVES)
		- Human eyes have superpower
			- visual system provides very high-bandwidth channel
		- Visual reasoning is way faster and more reliable than mental reasoning
			- perceptual interferences based on spatial location etc.
		- External representation or "external cognition"
			- augment human capacity beyond internal cognition and memory
			- information can be organised by spatial location
		- Summarise information without losing details (details on demand)
	- Human in the loop
		- many analysis problems are ill specified
			- many possible questions to be asked
			- human-in-the-loop exploration making use of human pattern detection
			- augment human capabilities rather than replacing the human in the loop
		- exploratory analysis for scientific discovery (data analysis)
		- visualization tools for presentation (communication)
			- presenting existing knowledge
	- Computer in the loop
		- visualisations of large datasets that might dynamically change over time
	- Showing dataset details
		- exploring a dataset to find patterns
			- not possible if you only see a summary of the dataset
		- assessing the validity of a statistical model
			- does the model fit the data?
		- statistical characterisation (descriptive statistics) of a dataset loses information through summarisation
			- single summary often an oversimplication hiding the true structure of a dataset
			- anscombe's quartet ("Anscombe's quartet **comprises
			   four datasets that have nearly identical simple descriptive statistics,
			   yet have very different distributions and appear very different when 
			  graphed**" wiki)
	- **Interactivity is necessary for vis tools handling complexity**
		- limitation of people and displays make it **impossible to show a large dataset at once**
		- change level of details
		- show **different aspect** of a dataset
		- different **representation and summaries** of data
		- different **presentation** of data
	- Difficulties in design
		- main issue is that **vast majority of the possibilities** in the design space will be **ineffective for any specific usage context**
		- design might be a **poor match with human perceptual and cognitive system**
		- design might be a **bad match with the intended task**
		- **design alternatives**: consider multiple alternative and choose the best one!
	- Search space metaphor for vis design
	- What-Why-How Question
		- What data is shown
		- Why is the visualisation tool used (task)
		- How is the vis idiom constructed in terms of design choices
	- Information visualisation process

- ## Lecture 2
	- General guidelines
		- design graphic representations should take human sensory capabilities into account
		- important data should be represented by graphical elements that are more visually distinct
		- Greater numerical quantities should be represented by more distinct graphical elements
	- Model of visual perceptual processing
		- Stage 1: Parallel processing to extract low-level features
			- billion of neurons working in parallel
			- orientation, colour, texture and motion
			- results in a set of feature maps
		- State 2: pattern perception
			- slow serial processing
			- continuous contours, regions of same colour or texture
			- two-visual-system theory: "Action" system and "What" system
		- Stage 3: Visual working memory
			- only a few objects in visual working memory
			- may provide answers to visual query (cognitive processing)
		- Attention affects all three stages
	- Cost and benefits of Visualisation
		- Where two or more tools can perform that same tasks, choose the one that allows for the most valuable work to be done per unit time.
		- Consider adopting novel design solution only when the estimated payoff is substantially greater than the cost of learning to use them.
		- Unless the benefit of novelty outweighs the cost of inconsistency, adopt tools that are consistent with other commonly used tools.
	- Gibson's Ecological Optics
		- Extract properties of surfaces
			- colour, texture
		- Ambient optical array
			- spherical array of light arriving at a given point
		- Optical flow
			- dynamic ambient optical array (moving objects, moving viewpoint)
			- perception of motion patterns
	- Anatomy of the human eye
		- variable focus **lens**
		- **pupil**
		- **retina**
			- what we see != image on the retina
			- two types of cells
				- rods, highly sensitive at low light levels
				- cones, three distinct colour receptors
			- brain forms our sight
				- focal length
				- maximum sharpness
	- Focus
		- Focus = focus distance
		- Depth of focus
			- distance eye-object = 50 cm
				- focus lies between 43 and 60 cm
			- distance eye-object = 3m
				- focus lies between 1.5m and infinite
	- Optimal Screen
		- use a high-resolution display with a moderate viewing angle for data analysis. This applies both to individual data analysis when the screen can be on a desktop and close to the use to collaborative data analysis when the screen muse be larger and farther away.
	- visual acuity
		- eyesight = retinal focus + brain interpretation
		- extent to which we can perceive details
			- ability to identify black symbols on a white back-ground at a standardised distance when the size of the symbols is varied
		- Important for the maximum density of data on a screen
	- Brightness
		- colour space can be divided into luminance (grey scale) and two chromatic (hue and saturation) dimension
		- light receptors in the eye
			- do not measure the amount of light on the retina
			- measure relative light changes over time and over adjacent spots on the retina
			- eye is a change meter rather than a light meter
			- Luminance refers to the measured amount of light coming from some region of space
	- Brightness illusion
		- Retinal ganglion cell receives input from multiple receptors(receptive field)
		- Processing tries to enhance edges
			- lateral inhibition from neighbouring neurons
	- Simultaneous contrast and erros
		- Simultaneous contrast effects result in large errors for quantitative information in grey scale
		- avoid using grey scale as a method for representing more than a few (two to four) numerical values
	- Contrast effects and shading
		- computer graphics shading algorithms (UGP)
			- uniforms (flat) shading
				- chevreul illusion
			- Gouraud shading
				- mach banding
			- Phong shading
				- smooth change with no appreciable Mach banding
	- Edge enhancement
		- Consider using Cornsweet contours instead of simple lines to define convoluted bounded regions.
	- Highlighting via contrast
		- consider using adjustments in luminance contrast as a highlighting method. It can be applied by reducing the contrast of unimportant items or by locally adjusting the background to increase the luminance contrast of critical areas.
	- Contrast crispening
		- more subtle grey values can be distinguished at the point of crossover
		- it subtle grey-level gradation within the bounds of a small  oj
