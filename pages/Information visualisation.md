	- What is Visualisation (Vis)?
		- **Computer-based visualisation systems provide visual representations of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively**
		- Augmentation of human capabilities
		- A vis idiom is a distinct approach to creating and manipulation visual representations
			- find best design for a particular task
		- Resource limitations
			- computers: computational capacity and scalability
			- humans: perceptual and cognitive capacity
			- displays: number of pixels
				- information density (data-ink ratio) = amount of information vs unused space
	- Why use Visualisation?
		- Human eyes have superpower (eyes beat memory)
			- visual system pro
