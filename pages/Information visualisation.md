	- What is Visualisation (Vis)?
		- **Computer-based visualisation systems provide visual representations of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively**
		- Augmentation of human capabilities
		- A vis idiom is a distinct approach to creating and manipulation visual representations
			- find best design for a particular task
		- Resource limitations
			- computers: computational capacity and scalability
			- humans: perceptual and cognitive capacity
			- displays: number of pixels
				- information density (data-ink ratio) = amount of information vs unused space
	- Why use Visualisation? (HVES)
		- Human eyes have superpower
			- visual system provides very high-bandwidth channel
		- Visual reasoning is way faster and more reliable than mental reasoning
			- perceptual interferences based on spatial location etc.
		- External representation or "external cognition"
			- augment human capacity beyond internal cognition and memory
			- information can be organised by spatial location
		- Summarise information without losing details (details on demand)
	- Human in the loop
		- many analysis problems are ill specified
			- many possible questions to be asked
			- human-in-the-loop exploration making use of human pattern detection
			- augment human capabilities rather than replacing the human in the loop
		- exploratory analysis for scientific discovery (data analysis)
		- visualization tools for presentation (communication)
			- presenting existing knowledge
	- Computer in the loop
		- visualisations of large datasets that might dynamically change over time
	- Showing dataset details
		- exploring a dataset to find patterns
			- not possible if you only see a summary of the dataset
		- assessing the validity of a statistical model
			- does the model fit the data?
		- statistical characterisation (descriptive statistics) of a dataset loses information through summarisation
			- single summary often an oversimplication hiding the true structure of a dataset
			- anscombe's quartet ("Anscombe's quartet **comprises
			   four datasets that have nearly identical simple descriptive statistics,
			   yet have very different distributions and appear very different when 
			  graphed**" wiki)
	- **Interactivity is necessary for vis tools handling complexity**
		- limitation of people and displays make it **impossible to show a large dataset at once**
		- change level of details
		- show **different aspect** of a dataset
		- different **representation and summaries** of data
		- different **presentation** of data
	- Difficulties in design
		- main issue is that **vast majority of the possibilities** in the design space will be **ineffective for any specific usage context**
		- design might be a **poor match with human perceptual and cognitive system**
		- design might be a **bad match with the intended task**
		- **design alternatives**: consider multiple alternative and choose the best one!
	- Search space metaphor for vis design
	- What-Why-How Question
		- What data is shown
		- Why is the visualisation tool used (task)
		- How is the vis idiom constructed in terms of design choices

- ## Lecture 2 (DATA)
  collapsed:: true
	- General guidelines
		- design graphic representations should take human sensory capabilities into account
		- important data should be represented by graphical elements that are more visually distinct
		- Greater numerical quantities should be represented by more distinct graphical elements
	- Model of visual perceptual processing
		- Stage 1: Parallel processing to extract low-level features
			- billion of neurons working in parallel
			- orientation, colour, texture and motion
			- results in a set of feature maps
		- State 2: pattern perception
			- slow serial processing
			- continuous contours, regions of same colour or texture
			- two-visual-system theory: "Action" system and "What" system
		- Stage 3: Visual working memory
			- only a few objects in visual working memory
			- may provide answers to visual query (cognitive processing)
		- Attention affects all three stages
	- Cost and benefits of Visualisation
		- Where two or more tools can perform that same tasks, choose the one that allows for the most valuable work to be done per unit time.
		- Consider adopting novel design solution only when the estimated payoff is substantially greater than the cost of learning to use them.
		- Unless the benefit of novelty outweighs the cost of inconsistency, adopt tools that are consistent with other commonly used tools.
	- Gibson's Ecological Optics
		- Extract properties of surfaces
			- colour, texture
		- Ambient optical array
			- spherical array of light arriving at a given point
		- Optical flow
			- dynamic ambient optical array (moving objects, moving viewpoint)
			- perception of motion patterns
	- Anatomy of the human eye
		- variable focus **lens**
		- **pupil**
		- **retina**
			- what we see != image on the retina
			- two types of cells
				- rods, highly sensitive at low light levels
				- cones, three distinct colour receptors
			- brain forms our sight
				- focal length
				- maximum sharpness
	- Focus
		- Focus = focus distance
		- Depth of focus
			- distance eye-object = 50 cm
				- focus lies between 43 and 60 cm
			- distance eye-object = 3m
				- focus lies between 1.5m and infinite
	- Optimal Screen
		- use a high-resolution display with a moderate viewing angle for data analysis. This applies both to individual data analysis when the screen can be on a desktop and close to the use to collaborative data analysis when the screen muse be larger and farther away.
	- visual acuity
		- eyesight = retinal focus + brain interpretation
		- extent to which we can perceive details
			- ability to identify black symbols on a white back-ground at a standardised distance when the size of the symbols is varied
		- Important for the maximum density of data on a screen
	- Brightness
		- colour space can be divided into luminance (grey scale) and two chromatic (hue and saturation) dimension
		- light receptors in the eye
			- do not measure the amount of light on the retina
			- measure relative light changes over time and over adjacent spots on the retina
			- eye is a change meter rather than a light meter
			- Luminance refers to the measured amount of light coming from some region of space
	- Brightness illusion
		- Retinal ganglion cell receives input from multiple receptors(receptive field)
		- Processing tries to enhance edges
			- lateral inhibition from neighbouring neurons
	- Simultaneous contrast and erros
		- Simultaneous contrast effects result in large errors for quantitative information in grey scale
		- avoid using grey scale as a method for representing more than a few (two to four) numerical values
	- Contrast effects and shading
		- computer graphics shading algorithms (UGP)
			- uniforms (flat) shading
				- chevreul illusion
			- Gouraud shading
				- mach banding
			- Phong shading
				- smooth change with no appreciable Mach banding
	- Edge enhancement
		- Consider using Cornsweet contours instead of simple lines to define convoluted bounded regions.
	- Highlighting via contrast
		- consider using adjustments in luminance contrast as a highlighting method. It can be applied by reducing the contrast of unimportant items or by locally adjusting the background to increase the luminance contrast of critical areas.
	- Contrast crispening
		- more subtle grey values can be distinguished at the point of crossover
		- it subtle grey-level gradation within the bounds of a small  object are important, create low-luminance contrast between the object and its background.
	- Monitor/projector setup
		- Ideally, when setting up a monitor for viewing data, a light neutral-coloured wall behind the screen should reflect an amount of light comparable to the level of light coming from the monitor. The wall facing the screen should be of low reflectance (mid- to dark grey) to reduce reflections from the monitor screen. Lights should be placed so that they do not reflect from the monitor screen.
		- When setting up a room for a projection system, ensure that minimal room light falls on the projector screen. This can be done by means of baffles to shield the screen from direct illumination. Low-reflectance (mid- to dark grey) walls are also desirable, as the walls will scatter light, some of which inevitably reaches the screen.
	- Colour Breaking Camouflage
		- apples and leaves
		- using red and green to distinguish the two instead of all grey
	- Cone cell sensitivity(SML)
		- Cone cells, located in the retina, are responsible for color vision and are ==most sensitive to bright light.
	- Colour Blindness
		- About 10% of the male population and about 1% of the female population have some form of colour vision deficiency
		- Most commonly a lack of either the L-cons (protanopia) or the M-cones (deuteranponia)
			- both of these result in an inability to distinguish red and green
	- Colour spaces
		- chromaticity coordinates
			- hue (h) and saturation (s)
			- luminance is treated separately
		- Different colours spaces defined by different triangles (3 primary colours)
			- sRGB
			- RGB
			- adobe RGB
		- hue = pure color (red, blue, green)
		- saturation = intensity of the colour
		- luminance = brightness
	- Saturation of small/large area
		- more saturated = small symbols, thin lines, or other small areas.
		- less saturated colours = large area
		- If using colour saturation to encode numerical quantity, use greater saturation to represent greater numerical quantities. Avoid using a saturation sequence to encode more than three values
	- Luminance contrast
		- When small symbols, text or detailed graphical representations of information are displayed using colour on a differently coloured background, always ensure luminance contrast with the background.
	- Form
		- If areas are defined using nearly equiluminous colours, consider using thin border lines with large luminance differences (from the colours of the areas) to help define the shapes.
	- Colour Contrast illusion
		- same colour but looks different because of the background colour
	- Colouring Maps
		- Use low-saturation colours to colour code large areas. Generally, light colours will be best because there is more room in colour space in the high-lightness region than in the low-lightness region.
		- When colours coding large background areas overlaid with small coloured symbols, consider using all low-saturation, high-value (pastel) colours for the background, together with high-saturation symbols on the foreground.

- ## Lecture 3 (DATA REPRESENTATION)
	- Data representation and abstraction
		- Detailed look at the what part of the what-why-how question
		- Provide a language that is meaningful and useful for vis design
		- Data is typically describe with domain language
			- translate the data into more abstract structure to find suitable visual representations
		- Data abstraction helps to narrow down the design space
	- Semantics and types
		- Many aspects of vis design driven by the kind of data
			- semantics (real-world meaning) (name, age, size)
			- types (data as well as datasets) (numbers, string)
		- What do the following datasets represent?
			- Basil, 7, S, pear
	- Data types (IALPG)
		- Item
			- individual discrete entity (table row or network node)
		- Attribute
			- also referred to as variable or dimension
			- property that can be measured, observed or logged
			- e.g. price or temperature
		- Link
			- relationship between items
			- e.g. between items (node) in a network
		- Position
			- spatial data
			- e.g. location in two-dimensional or three-dimensional space
		- Grids
			- sampling continuous data in term of geometric and topological relationships between its cells
	- Dataset types
		- tables
			- items, attributes
		- network and trees
			- items, links, attributes
		- fields
			- grid, position, attributes,
		- geometry
			- items
			- positions
		- cluster, set, list
			- items
	- Dataset
		- collection of information to be analysed
		- made out of the five data types
		- complex combination of basic dataset types are common
	- Tables
		- flat table
			- row represents an item of data
			- column represents an attribute of the dataset
			- a cell contains the value for a given item attribute
		- multidimensional table
			- indexing into a cell via multiple keys
	- Networks and trees
		- Network (graph)
			- defines relationships between two or more nodes (items) via links
			- nodes can have associated attributes
			- links can have associated attributes
			- e.g. people and their friendships or gene interaction network
		- trees
			- hierarchical structure without cycles
			- each child node has one parent node
			- e.g. company organisation chart or biological tree of life
	- Fields
		- Field
			- each cell contains measurements or calculation from a continuous domain
			- continuous data brings along the issues of sampling and interpolation
		- spatial fields
			- sampling at spatial positions
			- e.g. medical scan of a human body or measurements in wind tunnel
			- if spatial position is given with dataset, we talk abut
