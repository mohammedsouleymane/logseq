		- animated presentation in space and time
	- MindXpres Data visualisation
		- interactive data visualisation
		- interactive source code visualisation

		- Not a satellite image
		- 3D visualisation of one month of data
			- data collected by Nasa
		- Information visualisation can be misused to deliver the wrong message
	- What is Visualisation (Vis)?
		- **Computer-based visualisation systems provide visual representations of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively**
		- Augmentation of human capabilities
		- A vis idiom is a distinct approach to creating and manipulation visual representations
			- find best design for a particular task
		- Resource limitations
			- computers: computational capacity and scalability
			- humans: perceptual and cognitive capacity
			- displays: number of pixels
				- information density (data-ink ratio) = amount of information vs unused space
	- Why use Visualisation? (HVES)
		- Human eyes have superpower
			- visual system provides very high-bandwidth channel
		- Visual reasoning is way faster and more reliable than mental reasoning
			- perceptual interferences based on spatial location etc.
		- External representation or "external cognition"
			- augment human capacity beyond internal cognition and memory
			- information can be organised by spatial location
		- Summarise information without losing details (details on demand)
	- Human in the loop
		- many analysis problems are ill specified
			- many possible questions to be asked
			- human-in-the-loop exploration making use of human pattern detection
			- augment human capabilities rather than replacing the human in the loop
		- exploratory analysis for scientific discovery (data analysis)
		- visualization tools for presentation (communication)
			- presenting existing knowledge
	- Computer in the loop
		- visualisations of large datasets that might dynamically change over time
	- Showing dataset details
		- exploring a dataset to find patterns
			- not possible if you only see a summary of the dataset
		- assessing the validity of a statistical model
			- does the model fit the data?
		- statistical characterisation (descriptive statistics) of a dataset loses information through summarisation
			- single summary often an oversimplication hiding the true structure of a dataset
			- anscombe's quartet ("Anscombe's quartet **comprises
			   four datasets that have nearly identical simple descriptive statistics,
			   yet have very different distributions and appear very different when 
			  graphed**" wiki)
	- **Interactivity is necessary for vis tools handling complexity**
		- limitation of people and displays make it **impossible to show a large dataset at once**
		- change level of details
		- show **different aspect** of a dataset
		- different **representation and summaries** of data
		- different **presentation** of data
	- Difficulties in design
		- main issue is that **vast majority of the possibilities** in the design space will be **ineffective for any specific usage context**
		- design might be a **poor match with human perceptual and cognitive system**
		- design might be a **bad match with the intended task**
		- **design alternatives**: consider multiple alternative and choose the best one!
	- Search space metaphor for vis design
	- What-Why-How Question
		- What data is shown
		- Why is the visualisation tool used (task)
		- How is the vis idiom constructed in terms of design choices
	- Information visualisation process
		- Data ->
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Data representation (mapping) ->
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Data pesentation ->
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- perception and visual thinking ->
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- interaction -> links back to 1 - 3
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- ## Lecture 2
	- General guidelines
		- design graphic representations should take human sensory capabilities into account
		- important data should be represented by graphical elements that are more visually distinct
		- Greater numerical quantities should be represented by more distinct graphical elements
	- Model of visual perceptual processing
		- Stage 1: Parallel processing to extract low-level features
			- billion of neurons working in parallel
			- orientation, colour, texture and motion
			- results in a set of feature maps
		- State 2: pattern perception
			- slow serial processing
			- continuous contours, regions of same colour or texture
			- two-visual-system theory: "Action" system and "What" system
		- Stage 3: Visual working memory
			- only a few objects in visual working memory
			- may provide answers to visual query (cognitive processing)
		- Attention affects all three stages
	- Cost and benefits of Visualisation
		- Where two or more tools can perform that same tasks, choose the one that allows for the most valuable work to be done per unit time.
		- Consider adopting novel design solution only when the estimated payoff is substantially greater than the cost of learning to use them.
		- Unless the benefit of novelty outweighs the cost of inconsistency, adopt tools that are consistent with other commonly used tools.
