# TQBF and FQBF: PSPACE-Complete Problems
	- ## 1. Definition of the TQBF Problem
	  collapsed:: true
		- **TQBF (True Quantified Boolean Formula)** is the problem of determining whether a given quantified Boolean formula (QBF) is true.
		- A **quantified Boolean formula (QBF)** is a Boolean formula with leading **existential (∃)** and **universal (∀)** quantifiers. Each variable in the formula must be within the scope of a quantifier.
		- A QBF is either **TRUE** or **FALSE**. For example:
			- **Example QBF**: ∀x∃y (x ∨ y) ∧ (¬x ∨ ¬y) is a QBF.
			- **Non-QBF Example**: (x ∨ y) ∧ (¬x ∨ ¬y) is a Boolean formula but not a QBF because it is not quantified.
		- The **TQBF problem** is formally defined as:
		  
		  \[ TQBF = \{ \langle \phi \rangle \ | \ \phi \text{ is a QBF that is TRUE} \} \]
		  
		  ---
	- ## 2. Complexity of TQBF
	  collapsed:: true
		- **TQBF is PSPACE-complete.**
		- **PSPACE** is the class of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine using polynomial space.
		- PSPACE-completeness means a problem is among the "hardest" problems in PSPACE.
		- ### PSPACE-Completeness Criteria
		- 1. **TQBF is in PSPACE:**
			- A recursive algorithm can determine if a QBF is true using polynomial space.
			- If the QBF has no quantifiers, it evaluates to either TRUE or FALSE.
			- If the QBF is of the form ∃x ψ, evaluate ψ with x = TRUE and x = FALSE recursively, and accept if either evaluates to TRUE.
			- If the QBF is of the form ∀x ψ, evaluate ψ with x = TRUE and x = FALSE recursively, and accept if both evaluate to TRUE.
			- The recursion depth is at most n (the input length), implying TQBF is in SPACE(n) and therefore in PSPACE.
		- 2. **All problems in PSPACE are polynomial-time reducible to TQBF:**
			- Given a language **A** in PSPACE, construct a polynomial-time reduction from **A** to TQBF.
			- Let **M** be a Turing machine deciding **A** in space $n^k$.
			- Construct a QBF **ϕ** that simulates **M** on input **w** such that **ϕ** is TRUE if and only if **M** accepts **w**.
			- The QBF **ϕ** represents the computation history of **M** on **w**, with a tableau of at most **n** columns (max configuration size) and **d(n^k)** rows (max steps taken by **M**), where **d** is a constant.
			- Define configurations recursively using **ϕ(c₁, c₂, b)**, which asserts that **M** transitions from configuration **c₁** to **c₂** in **b** steps.
			- The reduction is computable in **O(n^{2k})** time.
			  
			  ---
	- ## 3. Complexity of the FQBF Problem
	  collapsed:: true
		- **FQBF (False Quantified Boolean Formula)** is the problem of determining whether a given QBF is **false**.
		- **FQBF is PSPACE-complete**, as it is the complement of TQBF.
		- Since PSPACE = coPSPACE, if a problem is in PSPACE, its complement is also in PSPACE.
		- Because TQBF is PSPACE-complete and FQBF is its complement, **FQBF is also PSPACE-complete**.
		- If a polynomial-time algorithm were found for FQBF, it would imply **P = PSPACE**, a major open problem in complexity theory.
		  
		  ---
	- ## Summary
	  collapsed:: true
		- **TQBF is a PSPACE-complete problem**, meaning it is one of the hardest problems in PSPACE. The problem is to determine if a quantified Boolean formula is **true**.
		- **FQBF is the complement of TQBF**. Since PSPACE = coPSPACE, **FQBF is also PSPACE-complete**.
		- Both problems remain fundamental in computational complexity, with important implications for theoretical computer science.
- # Undecidability, the Recursion Theorem, and the Halting Problem
	- ## 1. Decidability of the Given Problem
		- **Problem Statement:** Given a Turing machine (TM) **M**, does **M** halt on input **⟨M⟩** (its own encoding)?
		- **This problem is undecidable.**
		- This is a variation of the **Halting Problem**, where instead of testing if a TM halts on a given input, we test if it halts on its own encoding.
		- The **Halting Problem** (HALT_TM = {⟨M, w⟩ | M halts on input w}) is **undecidable**.
		- ### Proof by Reduction
		  1. Assume there exists a TM, **R**, that decides the given problem. That is, **R** accepts **⟨M⟩** if **M** halts on input **⟨M⟩** and rejects otherwise.
		  2. Construct a TM **S** to decide HALT_TM, which is known to be undecidable:
			- **S =** "On input ⟨M, w⟩:
			  1. Modify **M** to create a new TM **M'** that ignores its input and runs **M** on input **w**.
			  2. Run **R** on ⟨M'⟩.
			  3. Accept if **R** accepts, and reject if **R** rejects."
			  3. If **R** decides the given problem, then **S** decides HALT_TM:
			- If **M** halts on **w**, then **M'** halts on any input, so **M'** halts on **⟨M'⟩**, so **R** accepts ⟨M'⟩, so **S** accepts.
			- If **M** does not halt on **w**, then **M'** does not halt on any input, so **M'** does not halt on **⟨M'⟩**, so **R** rejects ⟨M'⟩, so **S** rejects.
			  4. Since no decider exists for the Halting Problem, we have a contradiction. Therefore, the given problem is **undecidable**.
			  
			  ---
	- ## 2. Formal Statement of the Recursion Theorem
		- **The Recursion Theorem:** "Let **T** be a Turing machine that computes a function **t : Σ* × Σ* → Σ***. Then, there exists a Turing machine **R** that computes a function **r : Σ* → Σ*** such that for every input **w**, **r(w) = t(⟨R⟩, w)**."
		- **Intuition:** There exists a TM **R** that can access its own description, **⟨R⟩**, and use it in its computation.
		- This theorem enables self-referential behavior in TMs.
		  
		  ---
	- ## 3. Using the Recursion Theorem to Prove Undecidability
		- **We prove that ATM = {⟨M, w⟩ | M accepts w} is undecidable.**
		- **Assumption:** Suppose ATM is decidable. Let **H** be a decider for ATM:
			- **H(⟨M, w⟩) accepts** if **M** accepts **w**.
			- **H(⟨M, w⟩) rejects** if **M** does not accept **w**.
		- ### Construction of TM **T**
		  1. **T(⟨M⟩, w):**
		   1. Run **H** on input **⟨M, w⟩**.
		   2. If **H** accepts, reject.
		   3. If **H** rejects, accept.
		  2. By the **Recursion Theorem**, there exists a TM **R** such that **R(w) = T(⟨R⟩, w)**.
		  3. Analyzing **R(w):**
			- **R(w) = T(⟨R⟩, w) =** If **H(⟨R, w⟩) accepts, reject**; if **H(⟨R, w⟩) rejects, accept**.
			- Since **H(⟨R, w⟩) accepts if R accepts w and rejects if R does not accept w**, we reach a **contradiction**.
		- ### Conclusion
		- The assumption that **H** exists is incorrect.
		- Therefore, **ATM is undecidable**.
		  
		  ---
	- ## Summary
		- The problem of determining if a TM halts on its own encoding is **undecidable**, shown via reduction from the Halting Problem.
		- The **Recursion Theorem** allows a TM to access its own description, enabling self-reference.
		- The theorem is crucial for proving the undecidability of problems like **ATM**.
- # Logarithmic Space Complexity Classes: L and NL
  collapsed:: true
	- Definitions of L and NL:
		- **L (Logarithmic Space):** L is the class of decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine using a logarithmic amount of space. This means that the amount of memory (tape cells) the Turing machine uses is bounded by O(log n), where n is the size of the input. The input itself is read-only and doesn't count toward the space used [1].
		- **NL (Nondeterministic Logarithmic Space):** NL is the class of decision problems that can be solved by a nondeterministic Turing machine using a logarithmic amount of space [1]. Similar to L, the space used is bounded by O(log n), but the machine is nondeterministic, meaning it can explore multiple computation paths simultaneously, and again the input is read-only and does not count toward the space used [1].
	- Relationship between L and NL:
		- L is a subset of NL because any deterministic Turing machine is also a nondeterministic Turing machine, meaning any problem solvable deterministically in logarithmic space is also solvable nondeterministically in logarithmic space [1].
		- The precise relationship between L and NL is unknown; specifically, it is not known if L = NL or if L is a strict subset of NL [2].
		- It is known that NL = coNL, meaning if a problem is in NL, then its complement is also in NL. This follows from the Immerman-Szelepcsényi theorem, which states that for every function f with f(n) ≥ log(n), NSPACE(f(n)) = coNSPACE(f(n)), implying NL is closed under complementation [2].
	- Relationship to other complexity classes:
		- **NL is a subset of P:** A log-space Turing machine has a limited number of configurations (specifically, O(n^k) for some constant k), so it can only run for a polynomial amount of time before repeating a configuration and looping [3]. Because any problem in NL is solvable by a Turing machine that runs in polynomial time, NL is a subset of P.
		- **L is a subset of P:** Since L is a subset of NL and NL is a subset of P, L is also a subset of P.
		- **NL is a subset of PSPACE:** P is a subset of PSPACE, and since NL is a subset of P, it follows that NL is also a subset of PSPACE.
		- **NL is a subset of SPACE(log^2(n)):** By Savitch's theorem, NSPACE(f(n)) is a subset of SPACE(f(n)^2). For log-space, this implies NL is a subset of SPACE(log^2(n)) [3].
	- NL-completeness and an example:
		- **Definition:** A language B is NL-complete if:
			- B is in NL [4].
			- For all languages A in NL, A is log-space reducible to B, meaning if we have a solution to B, we can solve all other problems in NL [4].
		- Log-space reducibility means there exists a function f computable in logarithmic space that transforms an instance of problem A to an instance of problem B such that the answer to A is "yes" if and only if the answer to B is "yes" [5]. This requires a log-space transducer with a read-only input tape, a read/write work tape using at most O(log n) space, and a write-only output tape [5].
		- **Example:** The problem PATH is NL-complete. PATH is the set of all tuples 〈G, s, t〉 such that G is a directed graph with a path from node s to node t [6, 7]. The proof of PATH being NL-complete shows that PATH is in NL, and all languages in NL are log-space reducible to PATH [7]. It also constructs a log-space transducer to perform this reduction [7, 8].
		- Another example of an NL-complete problem is **2SAT**, the set of satisfiable Boolean formulas in 2CNF (conjunctive normal form with exactly 2 literals per clause) [8, 9].
		  
		  In summary, L and NL are complexity classes defined by the amount of space a Turing machine uses. NL is the nondeterministic counterpart of L, and it is contained in $P, SPACE(log^2(n))$, and PSPACE. NL-complete problems are the "hardest" problems in NL, as any other problem in NL can be reduced to them using a log-space reduction.

- # NP, coNP, and Certificates
	- ### 1. Definitions of the Class NP:
	  collapsed:: true
		- **Direct Definition**: NP is the class of decision problems that can be solved by a nondeterministic Turing machine (NTM) in polynomial time. This means there exists an NTM that, for any input of size *n*, halts in at most *n^k* steps for some constant *k*. If at least one of the computation branches of the NTM accepts the input, then the input is considered to be in the language.
		- **Certificate-Based Definition**: A language *A* is in NP if there exists a polynomial-time verifier *V* such that:
			- *A = {w | V accepts ⟨w, c⟩ for some c}*
			- This means that for any string *w* in *A*, there exists a string *c* (the "certificate") such that *V* can verify that *w* is in *A* in polynomial time, based on *c*.
			- The size of the certificate must also be polynomial in the length of *w*.
	- ### 2. Intuitive Explanation of Equivalence:
	  collapsed:: true
		- The two definitions of NP are equivalent because the "certificate" definition effectively captures the power of nondeterminism.
		- **Nondeterministic TM Perspective**: An NTM can "guess" a potential solution (e.g., a path in HAMPATH or a factor in COMPOSITES) and then verify that the guess is correct in polynomial time.
		- **Polynomial-Time Verifier with a Certificate**: The certificate is the "guess" that the NTM makes. The verifier then checks if the guess is a valid solution in polynomial time.
		- Essentially, the NTM's ability to explore all possible computation paths simultaneously is mirrored by the verifier's ability to check any potential certificate in polynomial time. The certificate provides the specific "path" or "choice" that would have led the NTM to accept.
	- ### 3. Certificates for the Class coNP:
	  collapsed:: true
		- **coNP Definition**: The class coNP is the set of languages whose complements are in NP. If *A* is in coNP, then the complement of *A*, denoted as *Ā*, is in NP.
		- **Certificates for coNP**:
			- A language *A* is in coNP if there exists a polynomial-time verifier *V* such that *w* ∈ *A* if and only if for all certificates *c*, *V(⟨w, c⟩)* rejects.
			- In other words, for an input *w* in *A* (a coNP language), no certificate can convince *V* that *w* is not in *A*.
			- Conversely, *w* is not in *A* if and only if there exists a certificate *c* for which *V(⟨w, c⟩)* accepts.
		- **Example**:
			- *TAUTOLOGY* = {⟨ϕ⟩ | all assignments satisfy ϕ} is a coNP problem.
			- To show that *ϕ* is a tautology, we must show that no assignment falsifies *ϕ*, meaning that a certificate proving *ϕ* is not a tautology cannot exist.
	- ### 4. Certificates for Problems in NP ∪ coNP:
	  collapsed:: true
		- For problems in **NP**, there exist polynomial-size certificates that can be used to efficiently verify that a given input is in the language.
		- For problems in **coNP**, there is no such certificate that directly shows an input is in the language, but if an input *w* is **not** in the language, then there exists a certificate proving that *w* is in the complement language (which is an NP language).
		- **Key Difference**:
			- NP problems have certificates for membership.
			- coNP problems have certificates for non-membership (i.e., certificates for membership in their complement).
		- It is not known if all problems in **NP ∪ coNP** have certificates for both membership and non-membership, since it is not known whether **NP = coNP**.
		- It is known that **P ⊆ NP ∩ coNP**. If NP = coNP, then all problems in NP ∪ coNP would have certificates for both membership and non-membership.
	- ### **Summary:**
	  collapsed:: true
		- NP problems can be defined using nondeterministic Turing machines or with polynomial-time verifiers that take certificates, capturing the notion of efficiently verifiable solutions.
		- coNP is the complementary class, characterized by the existence of certificates that demonstrate an input is **not** in the language.
		- The relationship between NP and coNP is an open question, and whether every problem in NP ∪ coNP has both types of certificates is unknown.

- # PSPACE, NPSPACE, and their Relationship to Time Complexity
  collapsed:: true
	- **Defining PSPACE and NPSPACE:**
		- **PSPACE (Polynomial Space):** PSPACE is the class of decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine using a polynomial amount of space. This means that the amount of memory (tape cells) the Turing machine uses is bounded by a polynomial function of the input size *n*.
		- **NPSPACE (Nondeterministic Polynomial Space):** NPSPACE is the class of decision problems that can be solved by a nondeterministic Turing machine using a polynomial amount of space. Similar to PSPACE, the space used is bounded by a polynomial function of the input size, but the machine is nondeterministic, meaning it can explore multiple computation paths simultaneously.
	- **Relationship between PSPACE and NPSPACE:**
		- The sources state that PSPACE = NPSPACE. This is a significant result, and it is a consequence of Savitch's theorem.
		- **Sketch of Proof (Savitch's Theorem):** Savitch’s theorem demonstrates that any problem solvable by a nondeterministic TM using *f(n)* space can be solved by a deterministic TM using *f(n)^2* space. The conversion of an NTM *N* to a deterministic TM *M* involves using a recursive algorithm to test if a configuration of *N* can reach another configuration within a given number of steps. The deterministic algorithm needs to keep track of configurations in the recursion, requiring *O(f(n))* space per level of recursion and a recursion depth of *O(f(n))*, thus the total space is *O(f(n)^2)*. When *f(n)* is a polynomial function, then *f(n)^2* is also a polynomial function, so this shows NPSPACE is a subset of PSPACE. Because a deterministic TM is also a nondeterministic TM, we also have that PSPACE is a subset of NPSPACE, so we can conclude that PSPACE = NPSPACE.
	- **Relationship to Time Complexity Classes:**
		- **PSPACE contains P:** The class P (polynomial time) is a subset of PSPACE because a Turing machine that runs in polynomial time can use, at most, a polynomial amount of space. A TM that uses *t(n)* time can use, at most, *t(n)* space.
		- **PSPACE contains NP:** As shown above, P is a subset of PSPACE, and it is known that NP contains P. We also know that NP is a subset of PSPACE because any problem in NP can be verified using a polynomial amount of space. So it is true that PSPACE also contains NP.
		- **PSPACE is a subset of EXPTIME:** A TM that uses *t(n)* space cannot use more than *2^{O(t(n))}* time without repeating a configuration and looping. Therefore, PSPACE is a subset of EXPTIME (exponential time) because a Turing machine that runs in polynomial space is limited to an exponential number of possible configurations and thus will halt in exponential time.
		- **TIME(t(n)) ⊆ SPACE(t(n))**: Any Turing Machine that uses *t(n)* steps can use at most *t(n)* space. This means a TM that runs in polynomial time must also run in polynomial space.
		- **SPACE(t(n)) ⊆ TIME(2^{O(t(n))})**: A Turing machine that runs in *t(n)* space can be simulated in *2^{O(t(n))}* time.
		  
		  In summary, PSPACE and NPSPACE are complexity classes that relate to the amount of memory a Turing Machine uses. They are equivalent, as stated by Savitch's Theorem. They encompass polynomial time classes like P and NP and are contained within exponential time classes like EXPTIME.

- # Turing Machines, the Recursion Theorem, and Undecidability
  collapsed:: true
	- ### 1. Constructing a Turing Machine that Outputs Its Own Description
	  collapsed:: true
		- The notation for encoding objects into strings is defined as follows:
			- If **O** is an object, then **⟨O⟩** represents its encoding as a string.
			- If **O₁, O₂, ..., Oₖ** are objects, then **⟨O₁, O₂, ..., Oₖ⟩** encodes these objects into a single string.
		- A Turing Machine **M** is defined as:
			- **M** = "On input **w**, [English description of the algorithm]."
		- To construct a TM **M** that outputs **⟨M⟩** on any input:
			- **M** = "On input **w**:
				- Erase the input tape.
				- Write the string **⟨M⟩** on the tape.
				- Halt."
		- This ensures that **M** outputs its own description without using the recursion theorem.
	- ### 2. The Recursion Theorem
	  collapsed:: true
		- **Recursion Theorem Statement**:
			- For any Turing Machine **T** that computes a function **t(⟨M⟩, w)**, there exists a Turing Machine **R** that computes a function **r(w)** such that for all **w**, **r(w) = t(⟨R⟩, w)**.
			- Intuitively, this means that a Turing machine can obtain and use its own description during computation.
		- The recursion theorem ensures that a TM **R** exists such that its behavior on input **w** depends on its own description **⟨R⟩**.
	- ### 3. Using the Recursion Theorem for Undecidability Proofs
	  collapsed:: true
		- **Reducibility and Undecidability**:
			- If problem **A** is undecidable and reducible to problem **B**, then **B** is also undecidable.
		- **Example: Proving ETM is Undecidable**:
			- **ETM** = {**⟨M⟩** | M is a TM and L(M) = **∅**}.
			- Assume **ETM** is decidable, meaning there exists a TM **H** that decides **ETM**, where **H(⟨M⟩)** accepts if **L(M) = ∅** and rejects otherwise.
			- Construct a TM **R** using the recursion theorem:
				- Let **T** be a TM that does the following:
					- Construct a TM **M'** that behaves as follows:
						- On input **x**, if **x ≠ w**, reject.
						- Else, run **M** on **w** and accept if **M** accepts.
					- Run **H** on **⟨M'⟩**.
					- If **H** accepts, reject; otherwise, accept.
				- By the recursion theorem, there exists a TM **R** such that **R(w)** computes **t(⟨R⟩, w)**.
				- Thus, **R** is defined as:
					- "On input **w**:
						- Construct a TM **R'**:
							- If **x ≠ w**, reject.
							- Else, run **R** on **w** and accept if **R** accepts.
						- Run **H** on **⟨R'⟩**.
						- If **H** accepts, reject; otherwise, accept."
				- **Contradiction Analysis**:
					- If **L(R') = ∅**, **H** accepts **⟨R'⟩**, causing **R** to reject **w**.
					- If **L(R') ≠ ∅**, **H** rejects **⟨R'⟩**, causing **R** to accept **w**.
					- But **R** accepts **w** if and only if **R** does not accept **w**, leading to a contradiction.
			- Conclusion: The assumption that **ETM** is decidable is false, meaning **ETM** is undecidable.
	- ### Summary
	  collapsed:: true
		- A Turing machine can be constructed to output its own description.
		- The recursion theorem guarantees the existence of a TM that uses its own description in computations.
		- The recursion theorem is instrumental in proving undecidability results, such as the undecidability of **ETM**, by creating contradictions in decision procedures.

- # NL and coNL Complexity Classes
  collapsed:: true
	- ### 1. Defining NL and coNL
	  collapsed:: true
		- **NL (Nondeterministic Logarithmic Space)**:
			- NL is the class of decision problems solvable by a nondeterministic Turing machine using logarithmic space.
			- The amount of memory used is proportional to **log(n)**, where **n** is the input size.
			- The input tape is read-only and does not count toward the space bound.
		- **coNL (Complement of NL)**:
			- coNL consists of problems whose complements are in NL.
			- If a language **A** is in NL, then its complement **A̅** (all strings not in **A**) is in coNL.
	- ### 2. Relationship Between NL and coNL
	  collapsed:: true
		- **NL = coNL**:
			- A fundamental result states that **NL = coNL**, meaning that any problem solvable in nondeterministic log-space also has its complement solvable in nondeterministic log-space.
			- This result follows from the **Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem**, which proves that for any function **f(n) ≥ log(n)**, **NSPACE(f(n)) = coNSPACE(f(n))**.
		- **Proof Sketch of NL = coNL**:
			- A nondeterministic Turing machine using logarithmic space has a limited number of configurations.
			- It is possible to enumerate all configurations within log-space constraints.
			- A deterministic log-space Turing machine can verify whether a nondeterministic machine has a valid accepting path.
			- This leads to the conclusion that NL is closed under complement, proving **NL = coNL**.
	- ### 3. Relationship to Other Complexity Classes
	  collapsed:: true
		- **L ⊆ NL**:
			- Deterministic log-space problems (L) are a subset of NL since a deterministic machine is a special case of a nondeterministic one.
		- **NL ⊆ P**:
			- NL is contained within **P (polynomial time)** because a machine using log-space can have at most **O(n^k)** configurations.
			- This means an NL problem can be solved in polynomial time by simulating all possible configurations.
		- **NL ⊆ PSPACE**:
			- Since **NL ⊆ P** and **P ⊆ PSPACE**, it follows that **NL ⊆ PSPACE** (polynomial space).
		- **NP and coNP Relationship to NL**:
			- **NP is not necessarily contained in NL**, as NP problems may require more than logarithmic space.
			- **coNP is not necessarily in NL**, since we do not have a known inclusion of NP in NL.
	- ### 4. NL-Completeness and Examples
	  collapsed:: true
		- **Definition of NL-Completeness**:
			- A language **B** is **NL-complete** if:
				- **B** is in NL.
				- Every language in NL is log-space reducible to **B**.
			- Log-space reducibility means that an instance of problem **A** can be transformed into an instance of **B** using only logarithmic space.
		- **Examples of NL-Complete Problems**:
			- **PATH Problem**:
				- Given a directed graph **G** and two nodes **s** and **t**, does there exist a path from **s** to **t**?
				- PATH is **NL-complete**, as all problems in NL can be reduced to PATH via log-space reductions.
			- **2SAT Problem**:
				- Determines whether a Boolean formula in **2-CNF** (at most two literals per clause) is satisfiable.
				- **2SAT is NL-complete**, and PATH can be reduced to 2SAT using log-space reductions.
		- **coNL-Complete Problems**:
			- Since **NL = coNL**, any NL-complete problem also has its complement as a coNL-complete problem.
			- **Complement of PATH** (checking if there is *no* path between two nodes) is an example of a coNL-complete problem.
	- ### **Summary**
		- **NL and coNL** are complexity classes related to logarithmic space.
		- **NL = coNL**, proven by the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem.
		- **NL is contained in P and PSPACE** but is not necessarily related to NP.
		- **PATH and 2SAT are examples of NL-complete problems**.

- # P vs NP: A Complexity Theory Overview
  collapsed:: true
	- #### 1. Defining the Classes P and NP:
	  collapsed:: true
		- **P (Polynomial Time)**:
		  
		  P is the class of decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time. This means that an algorithm exists that can solve the problem in a time bounded by a polynomial function of the input size. Problems in this class are considered realistically solvable by computers.
		- **NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial Time)**:
		  
		  NP is the class of decision problems that can be verified in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine. In other words, if a solution (or "certificate") to a problem is proposed, a deterministic Turing machine can check whether the solution is correct in polynomial time. An equivalent definition is that NP is the class of problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a nondeterministic Turing machine.
	- #### 2. The P vs NP Problem:
	  collapsed:: true
		- **What is it?**
		  
		  The P vs NP problem is a major unsolved question in computer science that asks whether the class P is equal to the class NP. More simply, it asks whether every problem whose solution can be verified quickly (in polynomial time) can also be solved quickly (in polynomial time).
		- **Why should we care?**
		  
		  If P = NP, it would mean that many currently intractable problems (problems for which solutions can be verified quickly, but for which no efficient solution is known) would have efficient algorithms. This would revolutionize fields such as cryptography, optimization, logistics, and artificial intelligence, as many problems in these fields are in NP.
		  
		  If P ≠ NP, it would mean that there are inherent limits to what can be solved efficiently by computers, and certain problems cannot be solved in polynomial time.
	- #### 3. Conditions for Concluding P = NP or P ≠ NP:
	  collapsed:: true
		- **P = NP**:
		  
		  If a polynomial-time algorithm is found for any NP-complete problem, it would imply that P = NP. This is because all problems in NP can be polynomial-time reduced to NP-complete problems. Thus, if an NP-complete problem can be solved in polynomial time, all NP problems can also be solved in polynomial time.
		- **P ≠ NP**:
		  
		  If it could be proven that even one NP problem has no polynomial-time algorithm, then it would show that P ≠ NP. Current conjecture leans toward P ≠ NP, although no formal proof exists yet.
	- #### 4. Analyzing the Turing Machine Statement and its Decidability Implications:
	  collapsed:: true
		- **The Statement**:
		  
		  The statement involves a Turing machine (TM) M that runs in at most 100 steps. Based on whether P = NP, M outputs a string: "P equals NP" if P = NP, or "H" otherwise.
		- **Decidability of the P vs NP Problem**:
		  
		  The existence of such a Turing machine M (which halts in 100 steps) does not imply that the P vs NP problem is decidable. While the TM would produce an output depending on whether P = NP or P ≠ NP, the question of whether P = NP is an open problem in computability theory. A Turing machine cannot decide this question in a finite number of steps.
		- **Reasoning**:
		  
		  Even though a TM could be constructed to behave as described, the fundamental issue is that the P vs NP problem concerns whether polynomial-time algorithms exist for NP problems, which is unrelated to the creation of such a simple TM. The question of whether P = NP is undecidable, as it requires proving the existence (or lack thereof) of efficient algorithms, which no TM can conclusively resolve in a finite amount of time.
	- #### Summary:
	  
	  P and NP are core classes in computational complexity theory. The P vs NP problem remains one of the most important unsolved questions in computer science. While hypothetical Turing machines may simulate behavior regarding P and NP, they do not provide a method to definitively decide whether P equals NP, since this question involves deep computational and algorithmic issues that go beyond simple machine behavior.
