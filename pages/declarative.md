- First order term unification
  to unify two term
	- compare **their functors**, if they do not match fail, otherwise...
	- if the terms have different **number of arguments** then fail otherwise...
	- if they have **no arguments** succeed, otherwise...
	- for each arguments
		- if one is a variable, let it be identical to the other, otherwise
		- unify them using this procedure
- meta predicates
	- **var** is a meta-predicate which tests whether or not its
	  argument is a variable
	- **ground/1**, which succeeds if its argument is fully instantiated
	- **findall/3** is exactly analogous to running a query and asking for all the solutions by hitting ; at the prompt
- dlist
	- Difference lists are likely to help in improving any program
	  which uses append â€“ but. . . you cannot unify them!!!
	- Writing [a|X]-X = [a|Y]-Y has unpredictable results, because X and Y may have
	  different values
