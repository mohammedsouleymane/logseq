- What does science mean to you + refer to some philosopher of science
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
  collapsed:: true
	- Science is a structured way to understand the world and to prevent us from fooling ourselves, as stated by Professor Basterboer. This means there are checks and balances in place. Science can be seen as a product of humans, such as cars and ideas. Ultimately, the goals of science should be well-being, welfare, technological progress, or satisfying the cognitive need of humans to find answers to fundamental questions. Science should develop in an unconstrained manner to maximize the creativity of the researchers. The publication of scientific results should only be for the purpose of controlling and disseminating scientific knowledge.
	- Different philosophers have different views on science: 
	  Latour's Philosophy: Science is like Janus, looking forward and back. From a historical perspective, it looks like a series of successes, but for scientists, it's filled with failures. Science is a black box. To understand it, you have to open it up and look at the details of its development, the inconsistencies, and the collaborative efforts involved.

- Predatory journals and predatory conferences? Why are they a problem?
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
  collapsed:: true
	- They do not contribute to the advancements of science. They often lack rigorous peer review processes, which are crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of research.
	- They can damage the reputation of researchers who publish in them. Publications in predatory journals are often not recognized by the scientific community and can harm a researchers career prospects.
	- They waste resources. Money spent on publishing in these venues could be used to support legitimate research.
- What was the war of sciences + what does it mean to you
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
  collapsed:: true
	- The war of sciences was a conflict that arose in the 1990s between scientist and postmodernist thinkers. It was sparked by the postmodernist critique of the objectivity and universality of scientific knowledge, which some scientists perceived as an attack on science itself. The conflict was intensified by the Sokal hoax, in which in a physicist published a nonsensical paper in a postmodernist journal, highlighting the lack of a rigor in some areas of postmodernist thought.
	- Meaning: The War of sciences brought to light important issues about the nature of sciences, its relationship to other disciplines, and the role of objectivity and rigor in academic discourse. It led to increased awareness of the importance of clear communication critical thinking in all academic discipline.
- What is the scientific method for you? (refer to disciplinary & academic)
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
  collapsed:: true
	- There is no single scientific method but rather a collection of disciplinary methods. There is also a universal academic method:
	- Academic method(universal): Referencing providing a foundation for ideas using recognized reference sysetems.
	- Juxtaposing: Confront and comparing ideas for coherence through publication and presentation.
	- Assessment: Controlling the quality of ideas through peer review.
	- Persuasion: Convincingly communication ideas using disciplinary argumentation and rhetorical tools.
	- Scientific methods (disciplinary): Qualitative: Case studies, interviews and grounded theory. These methods focus on understanding the complexities and nuances of phenomena in their natural settings.
	- Quantitative: Experiments and surveys. These methods involve the collection of numerical data and statistical analysis to test hypotheses and make predictions.
- What is the importance of Galileo Galilei for publishing
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
  collapsed:: true
	- GG, published in 1610, is considered a landmark in the history of science communication. It was one of the first works to disseminate scientific findings widely and directly to the public, challenging the traditional control of knowledge by academic institutions. This helped to establish the importance of open communication and sharing of scientific discoveries.
- What is the research cycle and what is the research process
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
  collapsed:: true
	- Research Cycle
		- Start with a model that works
		- Encounter an anomaly
		- Adapt the model
		- Validate and verify
		- Arrive at a new model
	- Research Process
		- Conduct research
		- Implement control measures
		- Disseminate findings
- What is Sextus Empiricus Trilemma?
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
  collapsed:: true
	- Sextus Empiricus's Trilemma: A challenge to epistemic justification
	- Sextus Empiricus, a philosopher who proposed a trilemma that challenges our ability to justify knowledge claims. This trilemma, as outlined in the sources, presents three possible ways to base what we know:
		- Based on previous knowledge: **Infinite regress** is the never-ending chain of “why” questions.
		- Based on something that already belongs to our knowledge: **Circular reasoning** loops back on itself - “A is true because B is true, and B is true because A says so.
		- **Dogmatism**: They’re the beliefs we take for granted, things we accept without proof because they’re seen as “common sense” or “just the way things are.”
	- The trilemma highlights the difficulty of finding a secure foundation for knowledge. Each of the three options presents a logical flaw, suggesting that absolute certainty in knowledge might be unattainable.
- Why is induction only provable by induction?
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
  collapsed:: true
	- Induction reasoning involves drawing general conclusions from specific observations. The problem arises because the very act of justifying induction relies on inductive reasoning itself, creating a circular argument.
	- The nature of induction: We trust induction because it has worked in the past. We observe that repeated instances of a phenomenon lead to a consistent outcome, and we infer that this outcome will continue to occur in the future. This reliance on past experience to predict future event is the essence of induction.
	- Circular justificatoin: When we attempt to prove the reliability of induction, we inevitable fall back on inductive reasoning. We might argue: "Induction has worked successfully in many scientific disciplines" (multiple observations). Therefore, "induction is a reliable method" (general conclusion). This argument uses induction to justify itself, making it circular.
	- The problem of induction falls into the category of circular reasoning. In essence, the argument for induction is: "Induction works because it has worked before." While this might seem intuitively sound, it doesn't provide a solid, independent foundation for the validity of inductive reasoning.
- Explain the challenger problem (with O-ring) + importance
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
  collapsed:: true
	- The challenger space shuttle disaster exemplifies the critical role of data presentation and analysis in scientific decision-making. A key factor in the tragedy was the failure of the engineers to effectively communicate the risks associated with low temperatures and the performance of the shuttle's O-rings.
	- The O-ring issue: the space shuttle solid rocket booster were composed of segments joined by rubber O-rings. These rings were designed to seal the joints and prevent hot gases from escaping during launch. However, engineers had concerns about the O-rings' ability to function properly at low temperatures.
	- Data presentation: During the pre-launch discussions, engineers presented data on previous O-ring problems using qualitative diagrams. These diagrams were visually appealing but failed to highlight the crucial correlation between low temperatures and O-ring damage. The diagrams showed instances of O-ring damage across a range of temperatures, leading decision-making to believe that temperature was not a significant factor.
	- Importance of Visual representation: effective data visualization is essential for clear communication and informed decision-making. The challenger disaster demonstrated how the choice of visual representation can obscure crucial patterns and lead to misinterpretation. Had the data been presented in a way that clearly emphasize the relationship between low temperatures and O-ring damage, the launch might have been postponed
	- Cognitive biases: The challengers case also highlights the role of cognitive biases in decision-making. Confirmation bias, the tendency to favor information that supports pre-existing beliefs, may have influenced the decision to launch despite the concerns about the O-rings. The engineers and managers involved may have been overly focus on data that supported the launch and downplayed evidence that suggested risk.
	- lessons learned. The challenger disaster had a profound impact on NASA's safety culture and led to significant changes in the way risk assessments and decision-making processes were conducted. The disaster underscored the importance:
		- Effective communication
		- Critical evaluation of data
		- Openness to dissenting opinions
	- The Challenger disaster serves as a potent reminder that scientific and engineering decisions must be grounded in rigorous analysis, clear communication and a culture that prioritizes safety and critical thinking. It highlights the importance of understanding and addressing the human factors that can influence complex decision-making process
- What is the problem of the traditional view of science?
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
  collapsed:: true
	- The traditional view of science, often presented in textbooks, is often portrayed as a linear, straightforward process. This view can be problematic because it does not accurately reflect the complexities and non-linearity of actual scientific research. The traditional view can give a false impression that science is a simple process of following a set of steps, which can lead to misunderstandings about the nature of scientific inquiry.
	- Latour: Science is like Janus, looking forward and back. It looks like a series of successes, but for scientists, it's filled with failures. Science is a black box, to understand it, you have to open it up and look at the details of its development, the inconsistencies, and the collaborative efforts involved.
- How adequate is the traditional view of science? (Hypothetical, experiment, conclusion)
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
  collapsed:: true
	- The traditional view of science, which often involves a hypothesis, an experiment, and a conclusion, is not entirely adequate. Real research is much more complex and iterative, and it often involves going back and forth between different stages, adjusting hypotheses, and considering various factors that my influence the results. Trial and error. When you hit a roadblock  you go back make adjustments.
- How adequate is the current way of science?
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
  collapsed:: true
	- The current way of science if facing challenges due to various factors, including the increasing pressure to publish, the influence of funding sources, and the rise of questionable research practice. There are concerns that these pressures can compromise the integrity and reliability of scientific research. The focus on generating publishable results can lead to a neglect of potentially important research that might not yield immediate or sensational findings. This can hinder the progress of science and limit its ability to address crucial societal and scientific challenges.
- Why is the importance of Hanna Arendt as a philosopher of science?
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
  collapsed:: true
	- Important for her work on the nature of evil can be applied to understanding the motivations behind scientific misconduct.
	- In her book Eichmann in Jerusalem, she argues that Adolf Eichmann, a key figure in the Holocaust, was not a monster but rather a thoughtless bureaucrat who failed to engage in critical thinking and moral reflection. He simply followed orders without considering the ethical implications of his actions.
	- The sources connect this idea to the realm of sloppy science and fraud, suggesting that some researchers might engage in these practices not out of malice, but because they fail to think critically about the consequences of their actions.
	- Just as Eichmann's thoughtlessness enabled him to participate in horrific acts, a lack of critical reflection among researchers could lead them o produce flawed or fabricated data, potentially causing harm to others.
	- Most researchers do not intentionally set out to harm others. Applying Arendt's framework, the sources imply that promoting a culture of critical thinking and moral reflection within the scientific community could help to prevent sloppy science and fraud. By encouraging researchers to think deeply about the ethical implication of their work, the sources suggest that the scientific community can foster a greater sense of responsibility and intergrity.
- What is the importance of Randy Schekman as a philosopher of science?
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
  collapsed:: true
	- Schekmans argues that the pursuit of high impact factor publications has become and end in itself, leading to a "bonus culture" in science that is as detrimental as the bonus culture in banking. This emphasis on impact factors encourages researches to chase "sexy subjects" and make "challenging claims" to get published in prestigious journals, even if the research is not robust or replicable.
	- The focus on high-impact publications can discourage important but less flashy research, such as replication studies, which are essential for ensuring the reliability of scientific findings. Schekman's concerns echo a broader discussion in the sources about the pressures faced by academics, including the pressure to publish and the pressure to excel. Schekman advocates for a shift in focus from impact factors to other metrics that better reflect the quality and rigor of research.
	- Schekman's critique of the current publishing system contributes to a broader discussion in the sources about the need for reform in how scientific research is evaluated and disseminated. His perspective, offers valuable insights into the ethical and practical challenges facing the scientific community
- What is a reason for sloppiness?
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
  collapsed:: true
	- Sloppiness in research stem from factors like insufficient methodological training, time constraints, publication pressure, and personal attitudes. The increasing pressure to publish can incentivize researchers to cut corners or engage in QRPs to produce results quickly. This can lead to a decline and reliability of scientific research.
- What is the sloppy science spectrum? And why is it not a single group/category?
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
  collapsed:: true
	- The sloppy science spectrum encompasses a range of behaviors in the realm of scientific research, spanning from ethically acceptable practices to those that are ethically unacceptable. The spectrum is not a single group or category because it recognizes the diversity and complexity of questionable research practices.
	- The spectrum acknowledges that there are gray areas where certain actions might be considered tolerable depending on the context and disciplinary norms, while others are clearly reprehensible.
		- for instance, opportunism or cutting and pasting information might be view as minor infractions, where as fabrication data or engaging in plagiarism are unequivocally serious offenses.
		- The spectrum highlights the dynamic and evolving nature of scientific integrity, where societal and disciplinary standards influence what is deemed acceptable or unacceptable behavior.
	- The concept of a spectrum helps to move beyond a simplistic dichotomy of "good" vs "bad" science, recognizing that research practices exist on a continuum of ethical considerations.
- What is happening with young scientists?
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
  collapsed:: true
	- Young scientists are facing a challenging environment due to intense competition, job insecurity, and the pressure to publish in high-impact journals. This can lead to discouragement and burnout, and some may choose to leave academia altogether. The increasing demands and pressures on young researchers can hinder the development of new generation of scientists and stifle scientific innovation.
- Give 3 kinds of pressure that academic researchers face
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
  collapsed:: true
	- Pressure to excel: They need to excel in all aspects of their work, including research, teaching, management and public engagement
	  This creates an environment where mediocrity is unacceptable, leading to significant pressure on researchers to perform on a high level across all domains.
	- High work pressure: Academics often work long hours, with an average work week ranging from 55 to 70 hours -> can lead to burnout
	- High publication pressure: The system heavily emphasizes publications as a measure of success -> create immense pressure to produce a high volume of publications often at the expense of quality.
- What did Francis Bacon say?
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
  collapsed:: true
	- **Overcoming Human Limitations**:  Bacon argued that human understanding is inherently flawed due to the influence of "traditions, education, senses, passions". He believed that these factors distort our perception of reality, making it difficult to attain objective knowledge. To overcome these limitations, he stressed the importance of researchers working together, engaging in a structured and collaborative process to minimize individual biases and errors.
	- **The Importance of a Scientific Method**: Bacon advocated for a systematic approach to scientific investigation. He believed that science should be based on a clear protocol, involving the collection of empirical data, careful observation, and logical reasoning.
	  This emphasis on a structured methodology aimed to ensure the reliability and reproducibility of scientific findings.
	- **The True Ends of Knowledge**: Bacon believed that the ultimate goal of science should be to improve human life and well-being.
	- He argued that knowledge should be pursued "for the benefit and use of life", rather than for personal gain, fame, or power. This ethical dimension of Bacon's thought highlights the responsibility of scientists to use their knowledge for the betterment of society.
