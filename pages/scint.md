- What does science mean to you + refer to some philosopher of science
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Science is a structured way to understand the world and to prevent us from fooling ourselves, as stated by Professor Basterboer. This means there are checks and balances in place. Science can be seen as a product of humans, such as cars and ideas. Ultimately, the goals of science should be well-being, welfare, technological progress, or satisfying the cognitive need of humans to find answers to fundamental questions. Science should develop in an unconstrained manner to maximize the creativity of the researchers. The publication of scientific results should only be for the purpose of controlling and disseminating scientific knowledge.
	- Different philosophers have different views on science: 
	  Latour's Philosophy: Science is like Janus, looking forward and back. From a historical perspective, it looks like a series of successes, but for scientists, it's filled with failures. Science is a black box. To understand it, you have to open it up and look at the details of its development, the inconsistencies, and the collaborative efforts involved.
- What are predatory journals
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Predatory journals exploit the pressure to publish. They are journals or conferences that charge fees for the publication but do not provide quality peer review or editorial services.
- What is FFP + example + causes + reasons
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- FFP(Falsification, Fabrication, Plagiarism) is science fraud. It includes any deliberate act that hinders the positive development of scientific thinking.
	- Examples:
	  collapsed:: true
		- Making up experiments to convince others of a perceived truth.
		- Publishing a translation of an already published article without disclosing that is a translation.
	- Causes:
	  collapsed:: true
		- Insufficient instruction on methodology,
		- lack of ethics training, time constraints,
		- publication pressure,
		- personal attitude.
	- Reasons:
	  collapsed:: true
		- Feeling one's work is insignificant,
		- lack of time, lack of awareness,
		- believing that the data is wrong while personal beliefs are right,
		- prioritizing career advancement.
- What is QRP + examples + causes + reasons
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- QRP(Questionable Research Practices) is sloppy science. It includes thoughtless acts that may hinder scientific thinking. QRP is worse than science fraud because it is much more prevalent.
	- Examples:
	  collapsed:: true
		- Cherry-picking data,
		- omitting data to achieve significant results,
		- inadequate peer review.
	- Causes:
	  collapsed:: true
		- Insufficient instruction on methodology,
		- lack of ethics training, time constraints,
		- publication pressure,
		- personal attitude.
	- Reasons:
	  collapsed:: true
		- Feeling one's work is insignificant,
		- lack of time,
		- lack of awareness,
		- believe that data is wrong while personal beliefs are right and
		- prioritizing career advancement
- Predatory journals and predatory conferences? Why are they a problem?
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- They do not contribute to the advancements of science. They often lack rigorous peer review processes, which are crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of research.
	- They can damage the reputation of researchers who publish in them. Publications in predatory journals are often not recognized by the scientific community and can harm a researchers career prospects.
	- They waste resources. Money spent on publishing in these venues could be used to support legitimate research.
- What was the war of sciences + what does it mean to you
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- The war of sciences was a conflict that arose in the 1990s between scientist and postmodernist thinkers. It was sparked by the postmodernist critique of the objectivity and universality of scientific knowledge, which some scientists perceived as an attack on science itself. The conflict was intensified by the Sokal hoax, in which in a physicist published a nonsensical paper in a postmodernist journal, highlighting the lack of a rigor in some areas of postmodernist thought.
	- Meaning: The War of sciences brought to light important issues about the nature of sciences, its relationship to other disciplines, and the role of objectivity and rigor in academic discourse. It led to increased awareness of the importance of clear communication critical thinking in all academic discipline.
- What is the scientific method for you? (refer to disciplinary & academic)
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
  There is no single scientific method but rather a collection of disciplinary methods. There is also a universal academic method:
	- Academic method(universal): Referencing providing a foundation for ideas using recognized reference sysetems.
	- Juxtaposing: Confront and comparing ideas for coherence through publication and presentation.
	- Assessment: Controlling the quality of ideas through peer review.
	- Persuasion: Convincingly communication ideas using disciplinary argumentation and rhetorical tools.
	- Scientific methods (disciplinary): Qualitative: Case studies, interviews and grounded theory. These methods focus on understanding the complexities and nuances of phenomena in their natural settings.
	- Quantitative: Experiments and surveys. These methods involve the collection of numerical data and statistical analysis to test hypotheses and make predictions.
- What is the importance of Galileo Galilei for publishing
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- GG, published in 1610, is considered a landmark in the history of science communication. It was one of the first works to disseminate scientific findings widely and directly to the public, challenging the traditional control of knowledge by academic institutions. This helped to establish the importance of open communication and sharing of scientific discoveries.
- What is the research cycle and what is the research process
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Research Cycle
		- Start with a model that works
		- Encounter an anomaly
		- Adapt the model
		- Validate and verify
		- Arrive at a new model
	- Research Process
		- Conduct research
		- Implement control measures
		- Disseminate findings
- What is Sextus Empiricus Trilemma?
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Sextus Empiricus's Trilemma: A challenge to epistemic justification
	- Sextus Empiricus, a philosopher who proposed a trilemma that challenges our ability to justify knowledge claims. This trilemma, as outlined in the sources, presents three possible ways to base what we know:
		- Based on previous knowledge: **Infinite regress** is the never-ending chain of “why” questions.
		- Based on something that already belongs to our knowledge: **Circular reasoning** loops back on itself - “A is true because B is true, and B is true because A says so.
		- **Dogmatism**: They’re
		   the beliefs we take for granted, things we accept without proof because
		   they’re seen as “common sense” or “just the way things are.”
	- The trilemma highlights the difficulty of finding a secure foundation for knowledge. Each of the three options presents a logical flaw, suggesting that absolute certainty in knowledge might be unattainable.
- Why is induction only provable by induction?
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Induction reasoning involves drawing general conclusions from specific observations. The problem arises because the very act of justifying induction relies on inductive reasoning itself, creating a circular argument.
	- The nature of induction: We trust induction because it has worked in the past. We observe that repeated instances of a phenomenon lead to a consistent outcome, and we infer that this outcome will continue to occur in the future. This reliance on past experience to predict future event is the essence of induction.
