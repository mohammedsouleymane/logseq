- What does science mean to you + refer to some philosopher of science
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Science is a structured way to understand the world and to prevent us from fooling ourselves, as stated by Professor Basterboer. This means there are checks and balances in place. Science can be seen as a product of humans, such as cars and ideas. Ultimately, the goals of science should be well-being, welfare, technological progress, or satisfying the cognitive need of humans to find answers to fundamental questions. Science should develop in an unconstrained manner to maximize the creativity of the researchers. The publication of scientific results should only be for the purpose of controlling and disseminating scientific knowledge.
	- Different philosophers have different views on science: 
	  Latour's Philosophy: Science is like Janus, looking forward and back. From a historical perspective, it looks like a series of successes, but for scientists, it's filled with failures. Science is a black box. To understand it, you have to open it up and look at the details of its development, the inconsistencies, and the collaborative efforts involved.
- What are predatory journals
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Predatory journals exploit the pressure to publish. They are journals or conferences that charge fees for the publication but do not provide quality peer review or editorial services.
- What is FFP + example + causes + reasons
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- FFP(Falsification, Fabrication, Plagiarism) is science fraud. It includes any deliberate act that hinders the positive development of scientific thinking.
	- Examples:
	  collapsed:: true
		- Making up experiments to convince others of a perceived truth.
		- Publishing a translation of an already published article without disclosing that is a translation.
	- Causes:
	  collapsed:: true
		- Insufficient instruction on methodology,
		- lack of ethics training, time constraints,
		- publication pressure,
		- personal attitude.
	- Reasons:
	  collapsed:: true
		- Feeling one's work is insignificant,
		- lack of time, lack of awareness,
		- believing that the data is wrong while personal beliefs are right,
		- prioritizing career advancement.
- What is QRP + examples + causes + reasons
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- QRP(Questionable Research Practices) is sloppy science. It includes thoughtless acts that may hinder scientific thinking. QRP is worse than science fraud because it is much more prevalent.
	- Examples:
	  collapsed:: true
		- Cherry-picking data,
		- omitting data to achieve significant results,
		- inadequate peer review.
	- Causes:
	  collapsed:: true
		- Insufficient instruction on methodology,
		- lack of ethics training, time constraints,
		- publication pressure,
		- personal attitude.
	- Reasons:
	  collapsed:: true
		- Feeling one's work is insignificant,
		- lack of time,
		- lack of awareness,
		- believe that data is wrong while personal beliefs are right and
		- prioritizing career advancement
