	- ### 1. Learning from Data
	  
	  At its heart, machine learning asks a simple question: “Is learning possible?” We assume that an underlying pattern or function exists in nature—whether rating movies, approving credit, or recognizing coins—but that we can never write down its exact mathematics. Instead, we gather observations (data) to approximate this function. In learning from data, we choose a **hypothesis set** (a collection of possible models) and use a **learning algorithm** to select one hypothesis that best fits the data. This is the essence of what the PDF describes: using empirical evidence to approximate an unknown target function while recognizing that there is always uncertainty involved.
	  
	  ---
	- ### 2. Types of Learning
	  
	  Machine learning can be broadly divided into three categories:
	- **Supervised Learning:**  
	  In supervised learning, the dataset consists of input–output pairs. The goal is to learn the mapping from inputs (features) to outputs (labels or values). For example, predicting if a credit application should be approved (yes/no) based on applicant data fits this formulation.
	- **Unsupervised Learning:**  
	  Here, no “correct” output is given with the input. Instead, we try to discern structure or patterns from the raw data—such as clustering similar customers or reducing dimensionality (finding lower-dimensional features).
	- **Reinforcement Learning:**  
	  In reinforcement learning, an agent interacts with an environment and receives rewards or penalties. Rather than being given “correct” answers, the learner must try actions, learn from the outcomes, and improve its policy over time (as in grid world navigation or game playing).
	  
	  Each type of learning tackles different real-world challenges by exploiting different types of data structures and feedback.
	  
	  ---
	- ### 3. Perceptron Learning Algorithm (PLA)
	  
	  The perceptron is one of the simplest models for binary classification. In its basic form, it is a **linear classifier** that predicts the class label based on the sign of a weighted sum of the inputs. The PLA is an iterative algorithm:
	- **Initialization:** Start with a weight vector (often randomly or set to zero).
	- **Iteration:** At each step, pick a misclassified training point. Update the weights by adding (or subtracting) the input vector scaled by the label. In formulas, if \( x \) is a misclassified point with label \( y \), the update is:  
	  \[
	  w \leftarrow w + y \, x
	  \]
	- **Convergence:** If the data are linearly separable, the PLA is guaranteed to converge.
	  
	  ---
	- ### 4. Linear Models and Gradient Descent
	  
	  **Linear models** predict outputs by forming a linear combination of input features, expressed as  
	  \[
	  f(x) = w^T x
	  \]
	  In regression tasks, we often minimize a cost function such as the **squared error** over the training set. While there is an analytical solution (using the pseudo-inverse) for simple cases, in many situations we optimize the weight vector iteratively using **gradient descent**. This method computes the gradient (slope) of the loss function with respect to the weights and then updates the model in the direction that minimizes the error. Gradual, incremental improvements made by gradient descent are crucial when dealing with high-dimensional data or complex loss functions.
	  
	  ---
	- ### 5. Logistic Regression
	  
	  Although named “regression,” logistic regression is a classification algorithm. Instead of predicting continuous values, it models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class. This is achieved by applying a **sigmoid function** (also known as the logistic function) to a linear combination of the inputs:
	  \[
	  P(y=1 \mid x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-w^T x}}
	  \]
	  By interpreting model output as a probability, logistic regression allows for decision thresholds (e.g., classifying as 1 if the probability exceeds 0.5) and is typically optimized using gradient descent on the negative log-likelihood. Its probabilistic nature makes it especially appealing for binary classification problems.
	  
	  ---
	- ### 6. Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
	  
	  SVMs take the linear model idea further by not just finding any hyperplane that separates the classes, but by finding the one that **maximizes the margin**—the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points of either class (the **support vectors**). This maximal margin criterion generally leads to improved generalization on unseen data. SVMs can also use **kernel functions** to implicitly map the data into a higher-dimensional space where a linear separator may exist even if the original data is not linearly separable.
	  
	  ---
	- ### 7. VC Dimension
	  
	  The **Vapnik–Chervonenkis (VC) dimension** is a measure of the capacity of a hypothesis class. It answers the question: “What is the largest number of points that can be arbitrarily labeled such that there exists some hypothesis in our set that can correctly classify them?” For example, in two-dimensional space, a linear classifier (or perceptron) has a VC dimension of 3. A higher VC dimension means the model can fit more complex patterns, but it also risks overfitting. The PDF discusses how limitations on what the hypothesis can “shatter” (or classify without error) are central to understanding learning guarantees.
	  
	  ---
	- ### 8. Growth Function
	  
	  Closely related to VC dimension, the **growth function** counts the maximum number of dichotomies (i.e., distinct ways of labeling) that a hypothesis class can implement on any set of \( N \) points. For very simple hypothesis sets, this number is \( 2^N \) (all possible labelings), but when there is a break point (a point beyond which not all labelings are possible), the growth function grows only polynomially with \( N \). This concept is fundamental to learning theory and is used in bounds like the Sauer–Shelah lemma, which connects the number of realizable dichotomies with the model’s capacity.
	  
	  ---
	- ### 9. Overfitting
	  
	  **Overfitting** occurs when a model learns the noise or random fluctuations in the training data rather than the underlying pattern. An overfitted model will have excellent performance on the training set (low in-sample error) but is likely to perform poorly on new, unseen data (high out-of-sample error). Overfitting is often the result of an overly complex model relative to the amount of training data available. The PDF explains this idea by comparing \( E_{\text{in}} \) (in-sample error) and \( E_{\text{out}} \) (out-of-sample error) and emphasizes that learning theories aim to constrain this difference.
	  
	  ---
	- ### 10. Regularization
	  
	  **Regularization** is one common method to combat overfitting. It adds an extra term to the loss function—typically based on the size of the weights—to penalize overly complex models. Popular regularization methods include:
	- **L2 Regularization (Ridge):** Penalizes the square of the weights.
	- **L1 Regularization (Lasso):** Penalizes the absolute value of the weights.
	  
	  Both methods encourage simpler models that generalize better, effectively trading off a little training error for a significant gain in out-of-sample performance.
	  
	  ---
	- ### 11. Model Selection
	  
	  Choosing the right model from several candidates is the task of **model selection**. It involves:
	- Evaluating models on separate **validation** or **test sets**.
	- Using metrics that balance training error and model complexity.
	  This selection process is essential to ensure that the final model is not only a good fit to the training data but will also generalize to new data.
	  
	  ---
	- ### 12. Bias–Variance Tradeoff
	  
	  The **bias–variance tradeoff** is a core concept in understanding model performance:
	- **Bias** is the error incurred by approximating a real-world problem (which may be complex) with a simpler model.
	- **Variance** is the error introduced by sensitivity to fluctuations in the training set.
	  A model with high bias might be too simple (underfitting), while one with high variance might overfit the training data. The goal is to strike a balance that minimizes the total error (sum of bias and variance).
	  
	  ---
	- ### 13. Hoeffding Inequality
	  
	  The **Hoeffding inequality** is a concentration inequality that gives a probabilistic bound on how far the empirical mean (observed error on training data) can be from the true mean (error on the entire distribution). In the context of learning, it provides a bound on the probability that the in-sample error \( E_{\text{in}} \) deviates from the out-of-sample error \( E_{\text{out}} \) by more than a given amount. This inequality is fundamental in establishing **generalization bounds**, as it quantifies how many samples are needed to ensure that performance on the training set translates reliably to unseen examples.
	  
	  ---
	- ### 14. Generalization Bounds
	  
	  **Generalization bounds** are theoretical guarantees that relate the performance of a hypothesis on the training set to its expected performance on new data. They typically depend on:
	- The size of the training set.
	- The complexity of the hypothesis class (e.g., through the VC dimension or growth function).
	- Confidence parameters derived from probabilistic inequalities (like the Hoeffding inequality).
	  
	  These bounds help us understand when a low \( E_{\text{in}} \) can be trusted to imply a low \( E_{\text{out}} \).
	  
	  ---
	- ### 15. Validation and Cross-Validation
	  
	  To evaluate how well a learning algorithm generalizes, practitioners split data into:
	- **Training Set:** Used for learning.
	- **Validation/Test Set:** Used for evaluating performance.
	  
	  In **cross-validation**, the dataset is divided into several parts (folds); the model is trained on all folds except one, which is then used for testing. This is repeated so that every fold is used for testing exactly once. Cross-validation provides a more robust estimate of the model’s generalization performance.
	  
	  ---
	- ### 16. Noise and Outliers
	  
	  No dataset is perfect—**noise** refers to random variability or measurement errors in the data, while **outliers** are data points that deviate significantly from the majority of the data. In learning, it is important to design models that are robust to such imperfections. The PDF’s examples (like credit approval with inconsistent inputs) illustrate that sometimes even seemingly “identical” inputs may yield different outputs because of inherent noise, which complicates the learning task.
	  
	  ---
	- ### 17. Bayesian Learning
	  
	  **Bayesian learning** frames the learning problem in probabilistic terms by beginning with a **prior probability distribution** over the model parameters. As data is observed, Bayes’ theorem is used to update this prior into a **posterior distribution**. This approach naturally accommodates uncertainty about the model parameters, and instead of committing to a single hypothesis, one can reason with a whole distribution of hypotheses.
	  
	  ---
	- ### 18. Bayesian Inference (Bernoulli Case)
	  
	  In the **Bernoulli case**, the outcomes are binary (e.g., success/failure, yes/no). Bayesian inference here involves:
	- Starting with a prior (often a Beta distribution, which is conjugate to the Bernoulli likelihood).
	- Updating this distribution based on observed successes and failures using Bayes’ theorem.
	  The resulting posterior distribution quantifies our revised belief about the probability of success and plays a crucial role in making probabilistic predictions.
	  
	  ---
	- ### 19. Feature Transformations and Kernels
	  
	  When linear models are too simple to capture the complexity of the data, **feature transformations** are used to map the original inputs into a new space where the data might be more easily separable.
	- **Example:** Using polynomial features or other nonlinear transformations.
	  
	  **Kernels** take this idea even further in methods like SVMs. A kernel function computes an inner product in the transformed feature space without ever explicitly performing the transformation (the “kernel trick”). This allows the model to learn complex boundaries while keeping the computation tractable.
	  
	  ---
	- ### 20. Pocket Algorithm
	  
	  The **Pocket algorithm** is a modification of the PLA designed for cases where the data is not linearly separable. Instead of waiting for convergence (which might never occur), the algorithm “pockets” or remembers the best set of weights (the one that yielded the lowest error) encountered during training. This stored set is then used as the final hypothesis. The pocket algorithm is particularly useful when the PLA would otherwise cycle indefinitely in the presence of noisy data.
	  
	  ---
	- ### 21. Q-Learning and Grid Worlds
	  
	  In the realm of reinforcement learning:
	- **Q-learning** is a model-free algorithm that helps an agent learn the expected rewards (Q-values) of taking particular actions in given states.
	- **Grid worlds** are simplified environments where the agent moves in a grid-like maze. Each cell represents a state, and the agent must learn which actions maximize long-term rewards.
	  
	  Q-learning involves iterative updates based on the Bellman equation, gradually improving the Q-values until they converge to an optimal policy. This approach has been instrumental in solving many decision-making problems where the dynamics of the environment are initially unknown.
	  
	  ---
	- ### Wrapping Up & Further Thoughts
	  
	  Together, these concepts form the foundation of statistical learning theory and modern machine learning practice. They illustrate the journey from raw data to a working model—how to design algorithms (like the PLA and its pocket variant), measure model capacity (via VC dimension and growth functions), manage overfitting (through regularization and validation strategies), and even tackle decision-making problems in complex environments (with Q-learning).
	  
	  Beyond these topics, you may later encounter extensions such as deep learning architectures that, while built on these principles, add layers of complexity and new types of nonlinearity. You might also explore advanced Bayesian methods (e.g., hierarchical Bayesian models) or ensemble methods that combine multiple models for improved performance.
	  
	  Each of these topics invites many deeper questions—about how to best balance bias and variance, how to choose an optimal kernel function for SVMs, or how to design effective exploration–exploitation strategies in reinforcement learning. Would you like to dive even deeper into any one of these areas, perhaps exploring specific algorithmic challenges or real-world case studies?
- # Proofs
  collapsed:: true
	- d+1
		- We want to show that:
		  
		  $$
		  \text{VCdim}(\mathcal{H}_{\text{perceptron}}) = d + 1
		  $$
		  
		  That is, the set of all linear classifiers in $\mathbb{R}^d$ has a VC dimension of exactly $d + 1$.
		  
		  ---
		- ## 🔹 Part (a): Show that $\text{VCdim} \geq d + 1$
		- ### 🔸 Step 1: Constructing $d + 1$ Points
		  
		  We define $d+1$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that, when we include a bias term, the augmented vectors form the rows of a $(d+1) \times (d+1)$ matrix:
		  
		  $$
		  X = 
		  \begin{bmatrix}
		  1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
		  1 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
		  1 & 0 & 1 & \cdots & 0 \\
		  \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
		  1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1
		  \end{bmatrix}
		  \in \mathbb{R}^{(d+1) \times (d+1)}
		  $$
		  
		  * Each row $x_i^T \in \mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ corresponds to a point $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ with a prepended constant 1 (bias).
		  * This matrix $X$ is **nonsingular** (i.e., $\det(X) \ne 0$) — no row is a linear combination of the others.
		- ### 🔸 Step 2: Arbitrary Labelings
		  
		  Let $y \in \{+1, -1\}^{d+1}$ be any labeling (i.e., any dichotomy of these $d+1$ points).
		  
		  Since $X$ is invertible, we can solve:
		  
		  $$
		  Xw = y \quad \Rightarrow \quad w = X^{-1}y
		  $$
		- ### 🔸 Step 3: Perceptron Correctly Classifies
		  
		  Because $Xw = y$, we have:
		  
		  $$
		  \text{sign}(Xw) = \text{sign}(y) = y
		  $$
		  
		  Thus, the perceptron with weight vector $w$ perfectly classifies all $d+1$ points according to any labeling.
		  
		  ✅ **Conclusion:** These $d+1$ points can be **shattered**, so:
		  
		  $$
		  \text{VCdim} \geq d + 1
		  $$
		  
		  ---
		- ## 🔹 Part (b): Show that $\text{VCdim} \leq d + 1$
		  
		  Now we prove that **no set of $d+2$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$** can be shattered by a perceptron.
		- ### 🔸 Step 1: Linear Dependence
		  
		  Let $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{d+2} \in \mathbb{R}^d$, and let $\tilde{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ be the augmented vectors with bias (i.e., $\tilde{x}_i = [1, x_i^T]^T$).
		  
		  Then, since we have $d+2$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$, they must be **linearly dependent**. So:
		  
		  $$
		  \tilde{x}_{d+2} = \sum_{i=1}^{d+1} \alpha_i \tilde{x}_i \quad \text{for some } \alpha_i \in \mathbb{R}
		  $$
		  
		  Not all $\alpha_i$ are zero (since the first coordinate is 1 in each vector), and this linear dependence is unavoidable.
		- ### 🔸 Step 2: Define a Specific Labeling (Dichotomy)
		  
		  We define a labeling that the perceptron **cannot** realize:
		  
		  * For each $i = 1, \dots, d+1$:
		  
		  $$
		  y_i = \text{sign}(\alpha_i)
		  $$
		  * For $i = d+2$:
		  
		  $$
		  y_{d+2} = -1
		  $$
		  
		  This means that if a perceptron correctly classifies $x_1, \dots, x_{d+1}$ using weights $w$, then:
		  
		  $$
		  \text{sign}(w^T \tilde{x}_i) = \text{sign}(\alpha_i) \quad \Rightarrow \quad \alpha_i w^T \tilde{x}_i > 0
		  $$
		- ### 🔸 Step 3: Show a Contradiction
		  
		  Using the linear combination:
		  
		  $$
		  w^T \tilde{x}_{d+2} = \sum_{i=1}^{d+1} \alpha_i w^T \tilde{x}_i
		  $$
		  
		  Since each term $\alpha_i w^T \tilde{x}_i > 0$, their sum must be **positive**:
		  
		  $$
		  w^T \tilde{x}_{d+2} > 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{sign}(w^T \tilde{x}_{d+2}) = +1
		  $$
		  
		  But this contradicts the assigned label $y_{d+2} = -1$. Hence, **this dichotomy is not realizable** by any perceptron.
		  
		  ✅ **Conclusion:** The perceptron cannot shatter any set of $d+2$ points:
		  
		  $$
		  \text{VCdim} \leq d + 1
		  $$
		  
		  ---
		- ## ✅ Final Result:
		  
		  Combining both parts:
		  
		  * $\text{VCdim} \geq d + 1$
		  * $\text{VCdim} \leq d + 1$

	- ## Lecture 6
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### 1. **Introduction to Overfitting**
		  
		  The lecture begins by introducing the notion of overfitting, which is described as the scenario where a model fits the training data “too well.” In other words, the model goes beyond capturing the true underlying patterns and instead starts fitting random noise in the data. This excessive tailoring to the training data leads to a situation where the in-sample error (the error measured on the training set) becomes very low—even zero in some cases—while the out-of-sample error (the error on unseen data) becomes very high. This contrast is the hallmark of overfitting.
		  
		  ---
		- ### 2. **Illustrative Examples Using Polynomial Fits**
		  
		  The lecture uses simple polynomial fits to illustrate the idea:
		- **Noisy Data Points vs. Target Function:**  
		  A target function (displayed in blue) is given along with a set of noisy data points (shown as black circles) that do not lie exactly on the target curve because of noise in the observations.
		- **Using a High-Order Polynomial (4th Order) with Limited Data:**  
		  With very few data points available, fitting a 4th order polynomial forces the model to pass precisely through these points (in-sample error becomes zero). However, this “perfect” fit is deceptive because while it appears optimal on the training data, the model performs extremely poorly when attempting to predict new, unseen data.
		- **Comparing with a Lower-Order Polynomial (3rd or 2nd Order):**  
		  When using a simpler polynomial (for instance, a 3rd or 2nd order polynomial), the model cannot visit every data point exactly—so the in-sample error stays above zero. Nonetheless, this limitation often leads to a better generalization and a lower out-of-sample error. The overall message is that a model’s complexity should be chosen with respect to the available data; too complex a model for a small dataset will lead to overfitting.
		  
		  ---
		- ### 3. **Overfitting in Neural Networks**
		  
		  Beyond the polynomial example, the lecture extends the discussion of overfitting to neural networks. A typical training scenario is presented:
		- **Training Error vs. Validation Error:**  
		  The learning process is tracked over epochs (one complete pass over the data). Initially, when the network is randomly initialized, both the training error (E_in) and the out-of-sample error (E_out) are similar. However, as training progresses, the network increasingly “fixates” on the training data: the in-sample error continues to decline while the out-of-sample error, initially falling in tandem, eventually starts to rise. This divergence indicates the onset of overfitting.
		- **Early Stopping:**  
		  As soon as the out-of-sample error begins to worsen, it becomes advantageous to halt training—a strategy known as early stopping. This prevents the model from fitting the peculiarities or “noise” in the training data too closely.
		  
		  ---
		- ### 4. **Role of Noise—Stochastic vs. Deterministic**
		  
		  A key focus of the lecture is on noise and its role in overfitting. The discussion distinguishes between two types:
		- **Stochastic Noise:**  
		  This is the random fluctuation inherent in the data. Even if the true target function were perfectly smooth, measurements at different instances of a given input X might vary due to randomness. No hypothesis can capture this type of noise because it varies from sample to sample.
		- **Deterministic Noise:**  
		  This type of noise arises when the chosen hypothesis set (or model class) is not flexible enough to perfectly capture the true target function—even in the absence of randomness. It can be thought of as the error due to the inherent limitations of the model. For any given input X, deterministic noise remains fixed (or “deterministic”), unlike its stochastic counterpart.
		  
		  An analogy is provided: explaining complex ideas to a younger sibling might lead to misunderstandings (or “fitting the noise”) because of limitations in how the explanation is received. Just as the sibling’s interpretation introduces error, a model that fails to capture the full complexity of the target introduces deterministic noise.
		  
		  Moreover, while using a more flexible hypothesis set can reduce deterministic noise (by capturing more complexity), it does nothing about the stochastic noise, which remains an inescapable part of the data.
		  
		  ---
		- ### 5. **A Case Study: Comparing Hypothesis Complexity**
		  
		  The lecture then shifts to an experimental framework where target functions of various orders and corresponding noise levels are generated. Two hypotheses are compared for each scenario:
		- **H₂ (Simple Model):**  
		  A second order polynomial is considered as the simpler hypothesis. Even in the presence of noise, this model tends to yield reasonably low in-sample errors and, more importantly, modest out-of-sample errors.
		- **H₁₀ (Complex Model):**  
		  A 10th order polynomial, which, due to its high flexibility, can pass through most or all of the training points. While this guarantees that the in-sample error is extremely low, the out-of-sample error becomes catastrophic because the model is overly tuned to the noise present in the training data.
		  
		  A measure of overfitting is defined based on the difference between the out-of-sample errors from these two hypotheses. A positive value indicates that the high-order model (H₁₀) is overfitting relative to the simple model (H₂). The experiment emphasizes that overfitting worsens when the data set is small, when the noise level (stochastic noise) is high, or when the target complexity (deterministic noise) increases.
		  
		  ---
		- ### 6. **Interplay of Data Quantity, Noise, and Model Complexity**
		  
		  One of the main takeaways is that overfitting is highly sensitive to:
		- **Dataset Size:**  
		  A larger number of data points provides more information about the true target function—and the noise, too. Consequently, models, including high-order ones, can be fitted more accurately without overfitting if there is enough data.
		- **Noise Levels:**  
		  As the level of stochastic noise (σ²) increases, even a good model will have difficulty extracting the underlying pattern without overfitting. More data is required to “average out” this noise.
		- **Target Complexity:**  
		  A more complex target function (with higher polynomial order, for instance) injects more deterministic noise if the model is not sufficiently rich. This scenario further intensifies overfitting when model complexity is not regulated.
		  
		  Techniques like regularization—which impose penalties on model complexity—and proper validation are mentioned as critical tools to balance these factors and achieve better generalization.
		  
		  ---
		- ### 7. **Concluding Insights and Future Directions**
		  
		  The lecture concludes by reinforcing that both forms of noise—stochastic and deterministic—are “bad” from a learning perspective because they prevent the model from truly generalizing. The proper selection of the hypothesis set (and the use of automated methods to restrain model flexibility like regularization) is essential. In future lectures, as hinted in this transcript, further attention will be given to these methods, including a more rigorous discussion of validation techniques and even a Bayesian perspective on noise handling.
