	- Fault Tolerance desiderata: What are they, and how does the Akka Actor system address them?
	  collapsed:: true
		- The fault tolerance infrastructure desiderata are a set of requirements that a system should meet to be able to handle faults effectively. The Akka Actor system provides solutions to these requirements.
		- **Support Component Compartmentalization**: A faulty component should be isolated from others to prevent the fault from escalating to a total system crash.
			- Akka actors are supervised and organized hierarchically. A supervisor can decide to terminate a faulty actor, removing it from the system, and the hierarchy enables replacing actors at runtime.
		- **Support Suspension of Component Interactions**: Calls to a faulty component should be suspended until the component is fixed or replaced, enabling a smooth continuation of work.
			- If an Akka actor crashes, its mailbox is suspended until its supervisor decides how to handle the failure.
		- **Provide Component Lifecycle Management**: Isolate faulty components and terminate and remove or re-initialize components that cannot recover.
			- Akka actors are active components that can be started, stopped, and restarted, providing lifecycle management capabilities.
		- **Enable Separation of Concerns**: Fault recovery code, which is a cross-cutting concern, should be separated from normal processing code.
			- In Akka, actor message processing logic is separated from fault recovery logic, allowing them to be defined and evolve independently.
